What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Both are ways of combining two different branches, but in slightly different ways. A merge will preserve history, showing changes happening in both branches leading up to the merge. In other words, a merge demonstrates exactly how history occurred in the past. On the other hand, a rebase will reapply the changes made on the feature branch onto the main branch to create a linear commit history. This method of rewriting history makes it easier to read rebases, but may result in more conflicts.
